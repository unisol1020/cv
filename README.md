# My Unnecessarily Over-Engineered CV

## Because Why Not Use a Rocket Ship to Cross the Street?

Welcome to my CV project, where I've used Next.js to create what could have been a simple HTML page.

## Why Next.js?

Do I need a JavaScript framework with server-side rendering capabilities, automatic code splitting, and an optimized build system for a static CV?

**Absolutely not.**

Did I use it anyway?

**You bet I did.**

## The Philosophy

This CV was built on the rock-solid foundation of:

- "I can, therefore I will"
- "Overkill is underrated"
- "Who needs simplicity when you can have complexity?"

Some might say using Next.js for a CV is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. To them I say: have you considered how efficiently that nut would be cracked though?

## Features

- It's a CV
- It's built with Next.js
- That's pretty much it
- But it's Next.js!
- Did I mention it uses React 19?

## The Tech Stack I Definitely Didn't Need

- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Various other dependencies that a simple resume should never require

## Installation

Because a simple PDF wouldn't require you to:

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

## Conclusion

Could I have made this CV with plain HTML/CSS? Yes.
Could I have used a Google Doc? Also yes.
Could I have written it on a napkin? Probably.

But none of those options would have let me flex my unnecessary tech muscles. And isn't that what life is all about?
